# Flexcoin V4.8 All-in-One (GitHub Pages Ready)

- Place everything at repo root.
- Ensure GitHub Pages is pointing to the built `docs` or root as your setup requires.
- Images live at `/hero`, `/action`, `/nft-preview`. You can replace files without rebuilding.
- Whitepapers at `/whitepaper/*.pdf` (8 languages).
- Runtime config from `/config/*.json`.
- `resolveHeroMain()` shows `/hero/1.jpg` automatically if `/hero/main.jpg` is missing.
