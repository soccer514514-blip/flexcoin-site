# Flexcoin v3.9A – One‑Click Deploy Kit

Upload everything to the **root of your repository** (e.g., `flexcoin-site`) and push.
All links, images, roadmap, and on‑chain table are driven by `config/addresses.json`.

## Replace images
- `public/hero/main-hero.jpg` + `1..7.jpg` (1600×900)
- `public/nft-preview/1..8.jpg` (square)
Keep the filenames the same.

## Buttons
Pancake/Telegram/X/BscScan read from `config/addresses.json` and are **enabled by default**.

## PDFs
8 languages available in `/whitepaper`. Replace with your detailed PDFs later (same filenames).
